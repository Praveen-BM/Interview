1.Compareble And Comparator

	Compareble						               Comparator
	
	1.It provide Single Sorting Sequenc           1.It provide multi sorting sequency           
	i.e we can sort the collection on               i.e we can sort the collection based 
	the basedon single element						mutiple element
	
	2.It effects original class					  2.It doesnot effect Original class
	
	3.provide CompareTo()						  3.provide Compar()
	
	4.precented in java.lang package			  4.precented in java.util pacakege
	

2.Hash Map And Concurent Hash Table

	Hash Map									   Concurent Hash Mamp
	
	1.Methods are not syncronised				  1.Methods are syncronised
	
	2.not a thread safe							  2.Thread safe
	
	3.Fail-fash and throws an exception			  3.it is fail-safe and purforms 
	During itaretion								itaretion by multi thread
	
	4.it allows null as key						  4.it will not allow null as key
	
3.Array List And Linked List

	ArrayList									  Linked List

	1.Array uses Dynamic Array 					  1.Linked List Internally uses 
	internally										Dublilinked list
	
	2.Manupulation or modification is slower	  2.modification is faster than ArrayList
	
	3.it retrives the data fastly				  3.it retrives the data slowly than ArrayList
	
	4.impliments List							  4.implements both List and Queue
	
4.Hash Map And tree Map

	HashMap										  TreeMap
	
	1.usese hash table 							  1.uses red block tree
	
	2.allows single null key					  2.not allow null key
	
	3.it uses equal() to compare keys			  3.it uses compareTo() to compare
	
5.Stream And Collection

	Collection									  Stream										 
	
	1.to represent group of collection			 1.to purform bulk oparetion on object then we use Streams
	as single entity then we should use 
	Collection
6.Filter And Map

	Filter 										 Map
	
	1.it is used to fetch or filter				 1.
	the object from the collection we use 
	filter
7.Map and Flat Map
===================================
		HashMap											Hashtable
		Not synchronized (not thread-safe)				Synchronized (thread-safe)
		Generally faster								Slower due to synchronization
		Allows one null key and multiple null values	Does not allow null keys
