Basic Query:

Write an INNER JOIN query to retrieve all employees and their respective department names from employees and departments tables, using department_id as the key.
Filter with WHERE Clause:

Ans:select e.name,d.department_name from employees e inner join departments d where e.department_id = d.department_id;

How would you modify an INNER JOIN query to only return employees who work in the 'Sales' department?
Multiple INNER JOINs:

Ans:select e.employee_id,e.name,d.department_id,d.department_name from employees e inner join departments d where e.department_id = d.department_id and d.department_name='Sales';

Write a query to join three tables: orders, customers, and products, to get the customer name, product name, and order date.
Alias Usage:

Ans:select * from orders r inner join customers c on r.customer_id=c.customer_id inner join products p on p.product_id=r.product_id; 

How would you use table aliases in an INNER JOIN query to make it more readable? Provide an example.
Handling Nulls:(not required)

What happens if one of the tables in an INNER JOIN contains NULL values in the join column? Provide an example query and explain the result.
Combining INNER JOIN with Aggregates:

Write an INNER JOIN query to find the total sales amount for each product by joining sales and products tables.
INNER JOIN with Subqueries:

Provide an example of an INNER JOIN query that includes a subquery in the SELECT statement.
Self-Join:

What is a self-join, and how would you write an INNER JOIN query to find all employees who share the same manager?
Performance Considerations:

How can you optimize an INNER JOIN query for better performance? Provide specific strategies.
Handling Duplicate Columns:

If both joined tables have a column with the same name, how do you handle the selection of these columns in an INNER JOIN query? Provide an example.
